Tezos is an open source blockchain and application platform that can actually upgrade itself and develop smoothly.
Upgrades to the core protocol including the self-ammendment process itself are decided upon by the people who hold and stake the tezos coin. 
Meaning if you have some tezos, you can stake it and actually have some voting power in the network. 
Tezos token traded under the symbol xtz is also known as a tez. Tezos is not dependent on mining, instead token holders are rewarded for partcipating the blockchain's proof-of-stake (Pos) consensus method which is the reason why many say it is superior to ethereum.
You can also unstake the tezos anytime for any reason for no lock-up period being unique to other staking methods.

Biggest Problems for defy:
1) Transaction costs 
2) Self-ammendment process
3) Smart contracts

Similarities between Tezos and Euthereun
1) Both are blockchain based decentralized ledgers and smart contract platforms.

Differences:
1) Tezos- self-ammending process while euthereum- soft and hard fork system
2) Tezos- uses proof of stake consensus protocol while ethereum uses proof of work
